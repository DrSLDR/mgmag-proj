            #### Prepare a 25 minute presentation on your project for June 21 and/or June 23th. The presentation should include: 
            - Description of the overall project 
            - The game environment (conceptually: what are the characteristics of the virtual environment?; technically: what game engine?)
            - The AI-aspect you study in the game, and the reason for adding it to the game
            - The problems you encountered applying your AI-technique
            - A demonstration, or a very good explanation why you do not have one
            - Future work
            - Conclusion

            # Projects Description
            - Create virtual players for the boardgame Gravwell
              - Random 
              - Reinforcement learning AI
              - Neural Evolution AI
              - Decision tree
            - Goal is to have them beat at least the randomAI

            # GRAVWELL!!!

            Do I need to explain it again? Its implications on AI design?

            # Virtual Environment
              - (does he mean the software architecture or the game state design?)

              - engine class, (connects render, gamemanager and gameloop)
              - renderer class, (in contact with human_players GUI (for the card menus) to render the board based on a copy of the state)
              - factory class, (creates inital game state, and makes playertupples based on configurations)  
              - gamemanager class, (holds state, and updates it based on gravwell gameplay and players choices, informs each player of the state)
              - playertupple (player class (ship+hand of cards) and object of IPlayerController (interface) type)
              - state (holds playertupples, information about gravwell game phase, eventlog and deck-information)

            # Technical Environment
            - Pygame (started in 2000, latest version in 2009, but theyre still somewhat active)
              Used as Game engine and board rendering

            - PGU (Phils pyGame Utilities) 
              Used for gui

            - Tensorflow (only on ...linux? I only know its not Windows)
              Used to implement the Neural evolution (it can do math on the GPU and is thus fast)

            # AI-Aspect 
            - Learning
            - <Motivation here>

            - Implemented through:
              - Reinforcement Learning
              - Neural Evolution

            # Problems we ran into

            - Even WITH a headless version, the program was too slow to let the two AIs learn and grow enough
            - Fixed that by implementing clusters and multiprocessing
            - Could probably be optimized more

            - <problems with Reinforcement learning?>

            # Project Demo
            - (demo: short, because it is not that interesting to see)
            - (Explain that we made the GUI mostly so it was playable/testable by a human, and to have something to show now. The combination of GPU and rendering limited us, and not priority, so it is not majorly pretty)
            - (Note: start human-demo from console because the game closes immediatly if there is a winner)

            - let learn More
            - optimize speed
            - Change UI, possibly by removing PGU entirely
            - Try other types of AIs
            - Pit them against each other?

            # Conclusion
            - playable game, though not too pretty
            - 2 offline learning AIs, two non-learning agents
            - in x amount of games against 3 random AIs, <one of our AIs> wins the most often
