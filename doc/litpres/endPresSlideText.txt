Intro
- Title Slide
- project desciption
- gravwell description
			- boardgame 2-4players
			- path to finish is 54 tiles
			- playing cards to move forward: card= type,value and 'element' Name
			- important phases are
			  - Draft (choosing cards: as the stacks you choose have one visible and one hidden card, some of the card distribution among players stays hidden information)
			  - Play (playing a card from your hand each turn of a round. You play them face down)
			  - Resolve (played cards are shown and put into effect in alphabetical order. With an emergency stop (that can be used only once per turn) a card can not be put into effect)
- AI aspects and motivation
			- Decision making (natural addition to boardgame agent, as you decide between cards in your hand) 
			- learning (it seemed interesting to see if a strategy could be found)

			- implemented through four types (so we could later pit them against each other)
			  Random AI makes random decisions (these are sometimes good and sometimes completely idiotic)
			  we want to have our other AIs win from that one at least
Implementation of game
- virtual environment
- technical environment
			- PGU: Phils pyGame Utilities
			- tensorflow: it can do math on the GPU and is thus fast
Implementation of AI
- (implementation details?)
- problems
			- Too slow: because NE uses 300games to compare strategies, evolving it goes relitivaly slow
			- NE: best of mutated children goes to next generation. How do you find the best?
			(we tried: compete against 3RAI + compair scores (distance on the board), compete within children: compare scores with preseeded random per generation)
			- RL
Demo
- demo slide
            - (part of human interface (start from console))
            - (headless, to show we have it, and how fast it is)
            - GUI mostly made to have it playable/testable by a human, and for demo. Not priority, so not overly pretty
- statistic slide
			- Goal was: (learning to) win from the random AI
            - <show statistic results of winnings: different types against RAI>

              <pit them against each other>
Ending
- Future work
- Conclusion
